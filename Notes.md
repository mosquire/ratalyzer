# Notes:
* Warning message when lookups for factors don't work (data levels don't match rate table levels) identifying variables and records
* Compare factor levels in data to levels in lookuptables, generate report
* Get home data from Census Bureau?
* Create shorthand for aggregating premiums (by peril/coverage)
